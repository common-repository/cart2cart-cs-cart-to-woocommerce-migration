== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=Can Cart2Cart migrate from CS-Cart to WooCommerce my Multi-Vendor Marketplace?=
This option is possible. However, multi-vendor edition will be moved the same way as regular CS-Cart. Thus, there will be no possibility to transfer vendors separately or map them. All CS-Cart products (categories, orders etc.) from each independent vendor will be imported to one place - your WooCommerce store.
= Do you migrate multiple languages? =
Yes, Cart2Cart supports migration of multiple languages from CS-Cart to WooCommerce providing a paid WPML module is installed and configured on your WordPress before the data transfer. Please, <a href="https://www.shopping-cart-migration.com/faq/45-woocommerce/385007-is-multilanguage-migration-to-from-woocommece-possible">read our FAQ </a> for more info.

= Can I migrate product options to WooCommerce? = 
Due to WooCommerce peculiarities, Cart2Cart migrates product options to WooCommerce as product variants. However, you can install the paid Add-on on your WooCommerce store prior to data transfer, and your product options will be moved directly into the plugin without converting to variants.
